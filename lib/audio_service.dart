Steps:
1. Prepare Audio Assets:
  - Have engine sound files that loop seamlessly.
  - Optionally, have separate tracks for different RPM ranges.

2. Dynamic Playback with RPM Mapping:
  - Adjust the playback speed or pitch based on the ratio of current RPM to maximum RPM.
  - Ensure that the engine sound's maximum RPM aligns with the vehicle's maximum RPM.

3. Spatial Audio:
  - Use stereo panning to make the sound feel like it's coming from the engine's location.

4. RPM Mapping Formula:

playback rate = (currentRPM/User'sMaxRPM) x SoundMaxRPM

This ensures that as the vehicle's RPM approaches its maximum, the sound adjusts proportionally.
